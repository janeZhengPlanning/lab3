		  The recent 20 years have witnessed a surge of arts and<br> 
		  cultural management programs in China. Although the<br> 
		  idea of “arts management” or “cultural management” <br>
		  originally came from Europe and America in the late <br>
		  1980s, arts and cultural management education in <br>
		  China has its own definition and has grown on its own <br>
		  accord. A review of the Chinese cultural management <br>
		  literature shows that knowledge of cultural <br>
		  management education outside China is limited. To <br>
		  fill in the gap, this book is written to introduce the <br>
		  counterpart field in the West to serve Chinese cultural <br>
		  management educators. It is expected to enrich the <br>
		  Chinese literature on cultural management education. <br>
		  For China, experience from the West is crucial to <br>
		  prevent reinventing the wheel and to prepare <br>
		  educators in joining the international conversion on <br>
		  cultural management education. Research for this <br>
		  book project started in March 2016, and the data <br>
		  collection lasted for one year, and more than ten part-<br>
		  time research assistants participated in the data <br>
		  collection and translation. Furthermore, the writing <br>
		  and revision endured for one and a half year. The <br>
		  book was published by Chung Wah Book (Hong <br>
		  Kong) Limited Company in March 2019.
